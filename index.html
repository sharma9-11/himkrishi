      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>What Makes HimKrishi Different?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Highly Localized Profiles:</strong> Agriculture in the mountains is not one-size-fits-all. HimKrishi tailors its guidance based on your specific village, elevation belt, apple varieties, and the age of your trees.</li>
        <li><strong>BaghbanAI Assistant:</strong> Meet your 24/7 digital agronomy guide. Powered by advanced AI, BaghbanAI understands the official spray schedules and local conditions of Himachal. You can ask it questions about crop diseases, specific chemical recommendations, and weather alerts, and it will give you immediate, contextual advice.</li>
        <li><strong>Bilingual Support:</strong> Technology should be accessible to everyone. HimKrishi is fully bilingual, allowing you to seamlessly switch between English and Hindi (हिन्दी) so you can get information in the language you are most comfortable with.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy & Trust:</strong> We respect your livelihood and your data. Your orchard details are kept secure, and our transparent privacy policies ensure you are always in control of your information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our mission is simple: to help you increase productivity, reduce crop loss, and make informed decisions that protect your farm.
